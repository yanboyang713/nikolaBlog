&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The purpose of research is want to achieve a methodologic for finding which meachine translateor service combined with which English sentiment analysis service can obtain reliable sentiment analysis result for non-English speaker, who does not have sentiment analysis tool to analysis their own language.
&lt;/p&gt;

The research total have three parts.
Firstly, measuring meachine translation service quality base on sentiment analysis result from both side, as well as using around translation to test translation service quality.
