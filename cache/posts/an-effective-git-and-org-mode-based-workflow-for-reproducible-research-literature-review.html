In this paper we address the question of developing a
lightweight and effective workflow for conducting experimental
research on modern parallel computer systems in a reproducible
way. Our approach builds on two well-known tools
(Git and Org-mode) and enables to address, at least partially,
issues such as running experiments, provenance tracking,
experimental setup reconstruction or replicable analysis.
We have been using such a methodology for two years now
and it enabled us to recently publish a fully reproducible
article [12]. To fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposal, we have opened our two year laboratory notebook
with all the attached experimental data. This notebook and
the underlying Git revision control system enable to illustrate
and to better understand the workflow we used.
